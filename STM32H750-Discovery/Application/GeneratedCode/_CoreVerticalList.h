/* The class Core::VerticalList provides a generic vertical list view. Its purpose 
   is the presentation and the management of list items. Within the view the items 
   can be scrolled and the user can select them. This is very useful to show e.g. 
   the records from a data base. Within the view the items are arranged vertically 
   from top to bottom. If horizontal arrangement is desired, please use the class 
   Core::HorizontalList.
   - All items within the list view are objects of a predetermined item class. Depending 
   on this class, simple text items, image items or even complex GUI components 
   can be shown there. This class is defined in the property @ItemClass. Please 
   note, that only classes derived from Core::View are able to be shown. For example, 
   if you want to create a list of images, assign Views::Image to this property. 
   The height of all items is determined by the property @ItemHeight.
   - The entire number of list items is defined by the property @NoOfItems. By changing 
   this property the list can grow or it can shrink. Usually this value corresponds 
   to the number of items within the associated data source, e.g. to the number 
   of records in a data base.
   - This view is optimized to handle with very large lists consisting of thousand 
   of items. To preserve the memory, only the visible items will be stored there. 
   These will be created, loaded and discarded again automatically by the list view. 
   The only thing you have to provide is an external slot method, which is connected 
   to the view's property @OnLoadItem. Its job is to load an item with its content 
   from a data source. The affected item and its list index are available in the 
   variables @View and @Item.
   - The content of the list can be scrolled by modifying the property @ScrollOffset. 
   Additionally a Core::SlideTouchHandler can be attached to the list view so the 
   user can scroll the items interactively by touching the screen. The property 
   @SlideHandler allows it. 
   - With the property @Endless the list can be configured to start just after the 
   last item again with the first item.
   - The both properties @PaddingTop and @PaddingBottom permit to reserve additional 
   space just before the first and after the last item.
   - Within the list view one item can be selected. The index of the affected item 
   is stored in the property @SelectedItem. If the list view is focused, this item 
   also becomes focused. Focused items automatically receive keyboard events.
   - The method @GetItemsArea() is useful if the area occupied by one or more items 
   should be calculated. In contrast the method @GetItemAtPosition() tries to determines 
   the item which is lying at a given position.
   - The method @InvalidateItems() forces the list to re-load one or more items. 
   This method is very useful if the content of the affected items has been altered 
   in the associated data source.
   - The method @EnsureVisible() has the job to scroll the list until the given 
   item is visible. The method @AdjustList() in contrast tries to scroll the list 
   so the entire list view area is filled with items. Usually this is used after 
   the list size changes. */

/* The method DispatchEvent() feeds the component with the event passed in the parameter 
   aEvent and propagates it along the so-called focus path. This focus path leads 
   to the currently selected keyboard event receiver view. If the event is rejected 
   by the view, the same operation is repeated for the next superior view. This 
   permits the hierarchical event dispatching until a willing view has handled the 
   event or all views in the focus path have been evaluated. If the event remains 
   still unhandled, it will be passed to the component itself.
   The focus path is established by the property @Focus. 
   DispatchEvent() returns the value returned by the @HandleEvent() method of the 
   view which has handled the event. In the case, the event was not handled, the

/* The method UpdateViewState() is invoked automatically after the state of the

   to ensure the visual aspect of the component does reflect its current state. 
   For example, the 'enabled' state of the component can affect its colors (disabled 
   components may appear pale). In this case the logic of the method should modify 
   the respective color properties accordingly to the current 'enabled' state. 
   The current state of the component is passed as a set in the parameter aState. 
   It reflects the very basic component state like its visibility or the ability 
   to react to user inputs. Beside this common state, the method can also involve 
   any other variables used in the component as long as they reflect its current 
   state. For example, the toggle switch component can take in account its toggle 
   state 'on' or 'off' and change accordingly the location of the slider, etc.
   Usually, this method will be invoked automatically by the framework. Optionally 
   you can request its invocation by using the method @InvalidateViewState(). */

   start with the top most view.
   Beside the position, the additional parameter aFilter can be used to limit the
